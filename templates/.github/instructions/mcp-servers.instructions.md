# MCP Servers

Use configured MCP servers for enhanced development capabilities.

## Context7 - Documentation

Official documentation and established patterns.

**When to use:**
- API references and official guides
- Framework documentation and patterns
- Best practices and industry standards
- Code examples and implementation patterns

**Usage:**
```
"Find React hooks documentation - use context7"
"Show TypeScript generic patterns - use context7"
"Implement auth with library /supabase/supabase"
```

## Brave Search - Real-time Research

Current information and community knowledge.

**When to use:**
- Latest versions and compatibility
- Recent security advisories
- Community discussions and solutions
- Breaking changes and migration guides
- Current trends and benchmarks

**Usage:**
```
"Search latest security vulnerabilities 2025"
"Find recent performance benchmarks"
"What's new in TypeScript 5.x?"
```

## Playwright - Browser Automation

Web testing and data extraction.

**When to use:**
- End-to-end testing
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Screenshot capture for documentation
- Form automation and interaction
- Cross-browser testing

**Usage:**
```
"Navigate to /login and take screenshot"
"Fill contact form with test data"
"Extract product info from site"
```

## Combined Strategy

- **Context7**: Stable docs, official guides
- **Brave Search**: Current trends, recent changes
- **Playwright**: Testing, automation, scraping
- Cross-reference findings when needed

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Using Brave Search for stable API docs (use Context7)
- ❌ Manual web testing when Playwright can automate
- ❌ Ignoring MCP capabilities and researching manually
