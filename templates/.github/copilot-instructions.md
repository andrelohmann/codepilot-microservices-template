# Copilot Instructions for this Microservices Template

- This repository is a **multi-container microservices template**. It separates **services**, **backing-services** and **development-services**.
- Use `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.development.yml` marker blocks: **do not modify or delete marker lines**. Insert new service entries only between them.
- Placeholder tokens like `${serviceName}`, `${workspaceFolder}` must remain unexpanded in generated boilerplates.
- Do not overwrite core template files: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- After scaffolding, always output a summary of newly created or modified files.
